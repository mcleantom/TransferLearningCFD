# TransferLearningCFD

In design optimization of ships, you often fit a machine learning model to CFD data to allow you to optimize for a given parameter. Because of the high dimensionality of the search area, you need a lot of cfd points to get a good coverage of the optimization problem. In transfer learning, we can fit a large regression model to a dataset of previously ran CFD results to create a model that generalizes well to a number of types of vessels. When we want to design a new ship, we can use the large model to transfer knowledge (knowledge distilation) to the smaller model and use few-shot learning for fine tuning for the specific ship design. This way we have both a small model that has fast inference time as well as an accurate model that has gained knowledge about the general problem of ship resistance. The result is a model that out-performs a model that is trained solely on newly generated data.
